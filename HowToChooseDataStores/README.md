# How to choose data stores.
There are variety of data stores available in open source as well as from different cloud vendors. 
The landscape is quite huge and it can be a case of spoilt for choices.

## How to pick a data store?
Before we decide a data store for usage, we need to find the answer for the question
* What is type of data with which we plan to deal in terms of storage and computation?

This question does sound a little awkward and hence we may look at usecases that we are planning to handle. Based on the usecase, 
the nature of data can also be derived. Also based on the type of application we plan to build, the nature of data can be determined.
