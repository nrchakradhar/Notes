Modified Plantuml file based on multiple github links for Kubernetes.
Include the plant.uml as below:
```
!include <tupadr3/common>

!define K8SPlantUml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrchakradhar/Notes/master/K8SPlantUml
!includeurl K8SPlantUml/plant.puml
```
Refer to the [rbac-demo.puml](https://github.com/nrchakradhar/Notes/blob/master/K8SPlantUml/rbac-demo.puml) which shows the usage.

When rendered, it will look as below
