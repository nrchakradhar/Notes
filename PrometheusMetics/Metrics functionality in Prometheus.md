## Introduction
Prometheus is the most widely used observability tool in all cloud or non-cloud deployments. When somebody says they are using Prometheus, we need to ask 
the specific question about what exact functionality offered by Prometheus they are using. The need for this is due to the different use cases for which
and its eco-system has been used.
